                        <img src="glorious_anthem.png" alt="'Glorious Anthem' artwork by Raymond Swanland" width= "550" height="380">
                        <p>White represents order, peace, and light, and draws mana from plains. 
                        White planeswalkers can summon individually weak creatures that are collectively strong as a group such as soldiers, 
                        as well as powerful creatures and leaders that can impart buffs across all of the player's creatures. 
                        Their spells tend to focus on healing or preventing damage, protecting their allies, and neutralizing advantages on the battlefield by their opponents.</p>

                        <h2>Blue</h2>
                        <img src="propaganda.jpg" alt="'Propaganda' artwork by Clint Cearley" width= "550" height="380">
                        <p>Blue represents intellect, logic, manipulation, and trickery, and pulls its mana from islands.
                        Its magic is typically associated with the classical elements of air and water. 
                        Many of Blue's spells can interact or interfere with the opponent's spells as well as with the general flow of the game. 
                        Blue's magic is also associated with control, allowing the player to gain temporary or full control of the opponent's creatures. 
                        Blue creatures often tend to be weak but evasive and difficult to target.</p>

                        <h2>Black</h2>
                        <img src="desecration_demon.jpg" alt="'Desecration Demon' artwork by Jason Chan" width= "550" height="380">
                        <p>Black represents power, death, corruption, and sacrifice, drawing mana from swamps. 
                        Many of Black's creatures are undead, and several can be sacrificed to make other creatures more powerful, 
                        destroy opponent's creatures or permanents, or other effects. Black creatures may be able to draw the life taken in an attack back to their caster, 
                        or may even be able to kill creatures through a deathtouch effect. 
                        Black's spells similarly coerce sacrifice by the player or their opponent through cards or life.</p>

                        <h2>Red</h2>
                        <img src="lightning_bolt.jpg" alt="'Lightning Bolt' artwork by Kekai Kotaki" width= "550" height="380">
                        <p>Red represents freedom, chaos, fury, and warfare, pulling its power from mountains. 
                        Its powers are associated with the classical fire and earth elements, 
                        and tends to have the strongest spells such as fireballs that can be powered-up by tapping additional mana when cast. 
                        Red is an offense-oriented class: in addition to powerful creatures like dragons, 
                        red planeswalkers can summon weak creatures that can strike quickly to gain the short-term edge.</p>

                        <h2>Green</h2>
                        <img src="season_of_growth.jpg" alt="'Season of Growth' artwork by Randy Vargas" width= "550" height="380">
                        <p>Green is the color of life, nature, evolution, and indulgence, drawing mana from forests. 
                        Green has the widest array of creatures to draw upon, ranging across all power levels, 
                        and generally is able to dominate the battlefield with many creatures at play at once. 
                        Green creatures and spells can generate life points and mana, and can also gain massive strength through spells.</p>
